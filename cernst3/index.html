  				<p class="card-text">I came in as a freshman with the intent of majoring in Digital Media Studies and Environmental Science. As a result, I spent my freshman year taking mainly Biology and Chemistry courses. The spring semester of my freshman year I took CSC 161 in order to fulfill a Digital Media Studies Requirement; this was my first introduction programming. Though I went in with the attitude that I was going to hate it, I ended up falling in love with programming and ended up switching my second major to Computer Science.</p>
